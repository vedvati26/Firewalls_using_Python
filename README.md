# Firewalls_using_Python
This project is a foundational implementation of firewall functionality using Python, aimed at building network security capabilities from scratch. The firewall inspects and filters network packets based on user-defined rules, offering fundamental packet filtering, connection tracking, and logging features. This lightweight solution provides an educational look into the mechanics of firewall operations while allowing for practical experimentation with Python in network security.

Features
Packet Filtering: Define custom rules for filtering incoming and outgoing traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
Connection Tracking: Maintain session states to manage connections more effectively and provide stateful firewall capabilities.
Logging and Alerts: Log allowed and blocked traffic for analysis and receive real-time alerts for suspicious activity.
Rule Management: Add, modify, or delete filtering rules through a simple Python interface.
